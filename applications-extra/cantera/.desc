Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.

Cantera provides types (or classes) of objects representing phases of matter, interfaces between these phases, reaction managers, time-dependent reactor networks, and steady one-dimensional reacting flows. Cantera is currently used for applications including combustion, detonations, electrochemical energy conversion and storage, fuel cells, batteries, aqueous electrolyte solutions, plasmas, and thin film deposition.

Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written in C++ and Fortran 90.
