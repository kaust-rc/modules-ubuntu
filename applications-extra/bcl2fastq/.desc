llumina sequencing instruments generate per-cycle BCL basecall files as primary sequencing output, but many downstream analysis applications use per-read FASTQ files as input. Bcl2fastq combines these per-cycle BCL files from a run and translates them into FASTQ files. Bcl2fastq can begin bcl conversion as soon as the first read has been completely sequenced.
