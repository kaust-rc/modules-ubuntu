The IMSL Libraries are a comprehensive set of mathematical and statistical functions that programmers can embed into their software applications. The libraries save development time by providing optimized mathematical and statistical algorithms that can be embedded into C, C++, .NET, Javaâ„¢ and Fortran applications, enhancing return on investment and programmer productivity. The IMSL Libraries can also be used from Python using PyIMSL Studio or the PyIMSL wrappers.
