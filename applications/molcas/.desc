MOLCAS is a quantum chemistry software developed by scientists to be used by scientists. MOLCAS is a research product and it is used as a platform by the Lund quantum chemistry group in their work to develop new and improved computational tools in quantum chemistry. Most of the codes in the software have newly developed features and the user should not be surprised if a bug is found now and then.
