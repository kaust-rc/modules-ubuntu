ADF (Amsterdam Density Functional) is a Fortran program for calculations on atoms and molecules (in gas
phase or solution). It can be used for the study of such diverse fields as molecular spectroscopy, organic
and inorganic chemistry, crystallography and pharmacochemistry. A separate program BAND is available for
the study of periodic systems: crystals, surfaces, and polymers. The COSMO-RS program is used for
calculating thermodynamic properties of (mixed) fluids.
