Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina paired-end and single ended data.The selection of trimming steps and their associated parameters are supplied on the command line.

For single-ended data, one input and one output file are specified, plus the processing steps. For paired-end data, two input files are specified, and 4 output files, 2 for the 'paired' output where both reads survived the processing, and 2 for corresponding 'unpaired' output where a read survived, but the partner read did not.
